# Machine Learning Code Using R and Python

This project contains various Machine Learning algorithms implemented using python 3.0 compiled on jupyter notebook. 

## Overview

Each folder containg .ipynb file. Some of the dataset used were imported from library and some are uploaded in the folders as .csv file.

### Machine Learning Algorithms:

#### 1) [Linear Regression](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Regression)

Project description
#####  [Housing Data](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Regression/House%20Prices.ipynb)
- Worked on USA Housing data to predict price of house using various factors such as:
Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms & Area Population 
- Data File: train.csv, test.csv

#### 2) [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Regression)

##### [Titanic Data](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Regression/Titanic/titanic_script.r)
- Worked on Titanic data frame to predict survival or non survival of people on titanic
- Used mean to fill missing values
- Created dummy variables for categorical variables
- Data File: train.csv, test.csv

#### 3) [Decision Trees & Random Forest](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Decision%20Trees)

##### [Kyphosis Data]https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Decision%20Trees/Kyphosis.r)
- Predicted whether a person has Kyphosis or not using decision tree and random forest classifier based on data provided 
- Data File: kyphosis.csv

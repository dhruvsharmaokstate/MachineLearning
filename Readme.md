# Machine Learning Case Studies Using R and Python

This project contains various Machine Learning algorithms learnt in Machine Learning A-Z course by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves on Udemy implemented using Python 3.0 compiled on Jupyter notebook and Spyder, and it also includes codes implemented using R and compiled on RStudio. 

## Overview

Each folder contains either a .ipynb or a .r file. Some of the datasets used were imported from inbuilt libraries and some are uploaded in the folders as .csv file.

### Machine Learning Case Studies:

#### Regression
#### 1) [Linear Regression](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Regression)

#####  [Housing Data](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/blob/master/Regression/House%20Prices/Houses%20Prices.ipynb)
- Worked on USA Housing data to predict price of house using various factors such as:
Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms & Area Population 
- Data File: train.csv, test.csv

#####  [Graduate Admissions](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/blob/master/Regression/Linear%20Regression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
- Worked on USA Graduate Admissions data to predict chance of admissions to universities using various factors such as:
GRE Score, TOEFL Score, CGPA, University Rating, SOP, LOR, Research
- Data File: graduate-admissions.csv

#### 2) [Support Vector Regression](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Regression)

#####  [Wine Quality Assessment](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/blob/master/Regression/Support%20Vector/Support%20Vector%20Regression.ipynb)
- Worked on Wine quality data to assess quality of wine using various factors such as:
Acidity, Citric Acid content, Sulfur Dioxide content, Density, pH
- Data File: wine-quality.csv

#### Classification
#### 1) [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Regression)

##### [Titanic](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/blob/master/Regression/Titanic/Titanic_Script.R)
- Worked on Titanic data frame to predict survival or non survival of people on titanic
- Used mean to fill missing values
- Created dummy variables for categorical variables
- Data File: train.csv, test.csv

#### 2) [Decision Trees & Random Forest](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/blob/master/Decision%20Trees)

##### [Kyphosis Data](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/blob/master/Decision%20Trees/Kyphosis.R)
- Predicted whether a person has Kyphosis or not using decision tree and random forest classifier based on data provided 
- Data File: kyphosis.csv

#### [Lending Club](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/Decision%20Trees/Lending%20Club)
- Worked on Lending club data to predict if a borrower pays the money back to investor or not, using decision tree and random forest classifier
- Data File: loan_data.csv

#### 3) [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/tree/master/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors)
#### [Adult Income](https://github.com/dhruvsharmaokstate/MachineLearning/blob/master/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb)

- Worked on predicting a person's annual income by using various factors such as education level, age, gender, occupation etc
- Data File: adult.csv
